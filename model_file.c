/* Coverity Scan model
 *
 * This is a modeling file for Coverity Scan. Modeling helps to avoid false
 * positives.
 *
 * - A model file can't import any header files.
 * - Therefore only some built-in primitives like int, char and void are
 *   available but not wchar_t, NULL etc.
 * - Modeling doesn't need full structs and typedefs. Rudimentary structs
 *   and similar types are sufficient.
 * - An uninitialized local pointer is not an error. It signifies that the
 *   variable could be either NULL or have some data.
 *
 * Coverity Scan doesn't pick up modifications automatically. The model file
 * must be uploaded by an admin in the analysis settings of
